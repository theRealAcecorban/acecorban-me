                        This site serves as a collection of various implementations of the same basic application.  The purpose is to
                        demonstrate how vastly different tech stacks can be used to provide different solutions to the same problem. 
                        It is being hosted on an <span class="techHighlight">AWS S3 Bucket</span> and all DNS routing is managed via <span class="techHighlight">AWS Route 53</span>.

                        This is a basic application that allows a user to create an inventory of precious metals they physically own and provide 
                        an up to date valuation of their asset portfolio.  Each solution must allow for user registration, authentication and 
                        authorization so that everyone's collection is private to themselves.  It allows a user the ability to add, modify, or 
                        remove collections from their portfolio as needed.  In addition, a third party API is referenced to pull the latest 
                        spot prices of commonly collected metals and total valuations are calculated for the user in a simple table.

                        In order for this demonstration to be successful, all solutions must share the same data source for assets, 
                        which is stored using a <span class="techHighlight">Google Firebase Realtime Database</span>.  Additionally, authentication must be cross-domain
                        as different solutions will be hosted on different cloud services.  Authentication is managed via 
                        <span class="techHighlight">Google Firebase Authentication </span> and allows a user to either register with 
                        standard email/password or through their Google Account.
